isntall karma:
Typing ./node_modules/karma/bin/karma start is uncomfortable and so you might find it useful to install karma-cli globally.

$ npm install -g karma-cli

Then, you can run Karma simply by karma from anywhere and it will always run the local version

Then karma init to setup config file for the current instantiation
